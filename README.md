<!-- Major intro -->

**Edit, preview and learn reStructuredText and Markdown in your browser. Snippets is a lightweight playground for writing and previewing Sphinx documentation directly in your browser. It supports both reStructuredText (.rst) and MyST Markdown, giving you an instant way to try syntax, test examples, or prototype documentation without installing anything locally.**

<!-- Minor intro -->

The Snippets has started from the urge to quickly try, play and learn Sphinx reStructuredText and MyST Markdown syntax while developing the [Documatt](https://documatt.com), our app for creating beautiful documentation, manual, help, or book.

<!-- Highlights in points -->

_Edit reStructuredText or MyST Markdown_\
_See the Sphinx-rendered output instantly_\
_Runs fully in the browser → No installs, full privacy._\

<!-- Very short intro -->

Everything runs fully client-side thanks to WebAssembly (using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org)) and a bundled Sphinx build — no servers, no accounts, and no data leaving your machine. That means your experiments and drafts remain private by default. Snippets is especially useful for learning the syntax of Sphinx/MyST, teaching workshops, or quickly sharing examples with colleagues.

Whether you’re new to Sphinx or an experienced doc writer, Snippets provides a frictionless space to explore ideas. Open it in your browser, start typing, and see the rendered output update right away. It’s the fastest way to get hands-on with Sphinx docs.
