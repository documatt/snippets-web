Snippets? What is it?
*********************

****************
Document sharing
****************

If you open Snippets for the first time, you see empty document. It is autosaved and private as *draft*. If you close the browser, and open Snippets later, you continue where you left your document last time.

The document may stay as a draft forever, but if you want to share it with the world, it must be *published*.

Because Snippets is anonymous service, once published document, can't be modified or deleted later!

Published documents got themselves unique URL address which you can easily post on Facebook, Twitter, send it in email, SMS, etc. The document is no more private, and whoever knows its URL can access the snippet! Published snippets also discoverable by search engines.

URL of published document can be completely random (e.g. https://snippets.documatt.com/3883aLk, or based on a description you choose (e.g. https://snippets.documatt.com/a890na-pineapple-cheescake).

******************
Deleting documents
******************

If a draft document isn't accessed for more than 3 month, it's automatically deleted to save space for other users.

Since Snippets is anonymous service, once you publish the document, you can't delete. However, if nobody open published document for more than 1 year, we consider it as a *stale* and it maybe deleted sometime later.

If you publish the document by accident, or if you come across the document that violates our terms (e.g. it contains copyrighted information, abusive text, etc.), report it!

Document size
*************

At this moment, we don't set hard limit of a document length (a number of characters). However, from time to time, suspiciously long documents, may be deleted as spam and flooding prevention. Regular document written by humans are never such long, so you don't have to be worried about your documents.
